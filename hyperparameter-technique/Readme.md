# All Techniques of Hyperparameter Optimization
This project showcases a comprehensive exploration of different **hyperparameter optimization techniques** used to enhance machine learning models' performance. Hyperparameters are critical to the success of models, and tuning them systematically can lead to significant performance improvements. This notebook serves as a hands-on guide to applying multiple optimization strategies and automating the process using various libraries and algorithms.
## Key Sections:
### Techniques Covered
The following methods of hyperparameter tuning are explained and demonstrated:

1. ### **Manual Search**
   - A simple but time-consuming approach where parameters are tuned manually based on intuition or trial-and-error.

2. ### **GridSearchCV**
   - An exhaustive search over a manually defined grid of parameters, using cross-validation to assess performance.

3. ### **RandomizedSearchCV**
   - An efficient alternative to GridSearchCV, where only a random subset of the hyperparameter space is explored.

4. ### **Bayesian Optimization (using Hyperopt)**
   - Automates tuning using probabilistic models to select the best parameters iteratively.

5. ### **Sequential Model-Based Optimization (SMBO) with `skopt`**
   - A more structured, iterative search for the best parameters using prior knowledge to guide the process.

6. ### **Genetic Algorithms (using TPOT)**
   - Applies evolutionary algorithms to optimize hyperparameters by evolving pipelines over multiple generations.

7. ### **Optuna**
   - A state-of-the-art, lightweight framework for automated hyperparameter optimization that uses both random and grid search strategies.
