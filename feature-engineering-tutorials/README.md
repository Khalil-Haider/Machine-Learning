# Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

This project provides a comprehensive guide to data preprocessing and feature engineering, which are essential steps for preparing data for machine learning models. The notebook covers various stages of data cleaning, feature transformation, handling challenges like missing data, duplicate records, and outliers, and leverages advanced Python libraries for automation. Practical Python code examples using popular libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `autoimpute`, `fancyimpute`, `HyperImpute`, and `PyOD` are included to make the implementation seamless.

## Key Sections:

### 1. **Introduction to Feature Engineering**  
   - Overview of feature engineeringâ€™s importance in improving the accuracy and performance of machine learning models.  
   - Visuals that outline the various stages involved in the feature engineering process.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - **Handling Missing Data**: Multiple methods for handling missing data, including:
     - **Removal of Data**: Deleting rows or columns with missing values based on thresholds.
     - **Imputation**: Filling missing values using advanced techniques such as:
       - `autoimpute` and `fancyimpute` for robust imputation strategies.
       - `HyperImpute` for automatic, intelligent imputation.
   - **Handling Duplicate Data**: Identifying and removing duplicate entries to ensure dataset integrity.
   - **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Identifying and handling outliers using statistical methods and `PyOD` (Python Outlier Detection) to ensure the dataset is free from extreme values that could distort model predictions.

### 3. **Feature Transformation**  
   - **Scaling and Normalization**: Techniques to scale numeric data (using MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler) and ensure features are on comparable scales.
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converting categorical data into numerical form using one-hot encoding, label encoding, etc.
   - **Feature Interaction**: Creating new features based on interactions between existing ones to improve model predictions.

### 4. **Dealing with Imbalanced Data**  
   - Cover in  next step separately.
   
### 5. **Practical Code Implementation**  
   - Python code examples for applying preprocessing techniques on dataset using a range of libraries, including:
     - `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn` for core data manipulation.
     - `autoimpute`, `fancyimpute`, `HyperImpute` for handling missing data.
     - `PyOD` for detecting and handling outliers.
     - `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for visualization.

## Project Highlights:
- **Thorough Data Cleaning**: The project offers a comprehensive framework for cleaning raw datasets, from missing data to outlier detection.
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Along with basic techniques, the project uses advanced tools for feature creation, imputation, and data transformation.
- **Automation with Libraries**: Integration of `autoimpute`, `fancyimpute`, `HyperImpute`, and `PyOD` to streamline feature engineering and preprocessing steps.

## Requirements:
